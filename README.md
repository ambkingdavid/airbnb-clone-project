# Overview
The backend for the Airbnb Clone project is designed to provide a robust and scalable foundation for managing user interactions, property listings, bookings, and payments. This backend will support various functionalities required to mimic the core features of Airbnb, ensuring a smooth experience for users and hosts.
# Project Goals
- User Management: Implement a secure system for user registration, authentication, and profile management.
- Property Management: Develop features for property listing creation, updates, and retrieval.
- Booking System: Create a booking mechanism for users to reserve properties and manage booking details.
- Payment Processing: Integrate a payment system to handle transactions and record payment details.
- Review System: Allow users to leave reviews and ratings for properties.
- Data Optimization: Ensure efficient data retrieval and storage through database optimizations.
# Team Roles
- Backend Developer: Responsible for implementing API endpoints, database schemas, and business logic.
- Database Administrator: Manages database design, indexing, and optimizations.
- DevOps Engineer: Handles deployment, monitoring, and scaling of the backend services.
- QA Engineer: Ensures the backend functionalities are thoroughly tested and meet quality standards.
# Technology Stack
-Django: A high-level Python web framework used for building the RESTful API.
- Django REST Framework: Provides tools for creating and managing RESTful APIs.
- PostgreSQL: A powerful relational database used for data storage.
- GraphQL: Allows for flexible and efficient querying of data.
- Celery: For handling asynchronous tasks such as sending notifications or processing payments.
- Redis: Used for caching and session management.
- Docker: Containerization tool for consistent development and deployment environments.
- CI/CD Pipelines: Automated pipelines for testing and deploying code changes.
# Database Design
Entities and Fields
- Users: id, name, email, password, created_at
- Properties: id, owner_id, title, location, price
- Bookings: id, user_id, property_id, start_date, end_date
- Reviews: id, user_id, property_id, rating, comment
- Payments: id, booking_id, amount, status, payment_date

Relationships
- One user can own multiple properties
- A booking belongs to one user and one property
- A property can have many reviews
- Each booking has one payment record
